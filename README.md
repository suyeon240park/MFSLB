# MFSLB (Make Finance Secretary's Life Better)
MFSLB is a tool designed to streamline and automate the application processes within the Finance Committee at the University of Toronto Engineering Society. Built using JavaScript and powered by Google Apps Script, it leverages the simplicity of the language and its integration with Google Services. The project was developed by Finance Secretary Suyeon Park and Members at Large Kenneth Sulimro from 2023 to 2024 to alleviate the time-consuming tasks associated with preparing for monthly Finance Committee meetings, which previously took over five hours - Now it is done with just one click!
